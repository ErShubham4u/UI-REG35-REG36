CSS Syntax


Inline, Internal, and External CSS

Inline CSS

An inline style may apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. 
The style attribute can contain any CSS property.



<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Internal CSS

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

External CSS

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by
changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the
<link> element, inside the head section.

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>


Selectors in CSS


Element Selector

The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

class Selector

The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by
the class name.



.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

id Selector

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to 
select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, 
followed by the id of the element.

#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}


Universal Selector : *

The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

* {
    text-align: center;
    color: blue;
}

Grouping Selector

The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

Nested Selector

The nested selectors select an HTML Element inside another HTML element by making
 a nested reference. 
To make a nested selector, separate each selector with a space in the hierarchy.

body .center p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}










CSS Color property

Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values. 
In CSS, a color can be specified by using a predefined color name:


Units in CSS

Absolute Unit

px unit

px unit is fixed in size no matter what screen size you choose. That's why the px
unit is always preferred for borders because borders are also kept fixed across
all screen sizes.

Percentage Unit

This is used for setting the width of an element and it's always relative to its
immediate parent element size. If there's no defined parent then by default body is
considered the parent.



Relative Unit

Relative to font size:

em unit

The em unit is always relative to the font size of its immediate parent. 1em
== to the size of the parent's font size. The default font size is 16px if not
overridden, let's say in the parent element the font size is 48px then in the
child element 1em == 48px.

rem unit (r stands for root em)

And unlike em it's always relative to the root font size no matter what font
size it's very next parent element has. if the root has redefined font-size like
60px then 1rem == 60px in child.


Relative to view port/document

vw and vh units

vw stands for the viewport width which means vw is always relative to the
1% of the width of root, irrespective of parent element's width. So, if 1vw ==
1% then 100vw == 100% of the viewport width.

Similarly vh stands for viewport height like vw it's also relative to the 1%
height of root/document.








How to decide CSS Units for a responsive website:

px unit for borders.
% unit for width relative to the parent.
em unit for margin and padding relative to fonts size of element.
rem unit for fonts size relative to root.
vw and vh for width and height relative to root.










CSS Box Model

The Div Tag

The  <div>  tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. 
The  <div>  tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or
manipulated with JavaScript.
The  <div>  tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
Any sort of content can be put inside the  <div>  tag!


Margin vs Padding

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

We use margin and padding attributes with left, right, top and bottom extensions to
further fine-tune the values.
